# Rag's HXUI

This is a fork of the original HXUI (https://github.com/tirem/HXUI/)

It combines the following changes:

- Alliance party windows & display job points in Exp bar & JP Text fixes by Onimitch: https://github.com/onimitch/HXUI/releases/tag/onimitch4
- Adds debuff timers underneath the Target Bar similar to ConteAlmaviva's fork but cleaned up: https://github.com/ConteAlmaviva/HXUI/

This fork also:

- Adds the ability to hide distance display from the Target Bar.
- Adds the ability to display distance on Party List and Enemy List.
- Adds the ability to highlight party member names on Party List when within a set distance.
- Fixes the timers for multiple debuffs as these were all wrong (for 75-era).
- Adds fast cast and calculations to cast bar so that casts actually finish at 100% instead of 75% or lower. Default values are provided based on BiS for 75-era and can be adjusted.
- Adds the ability to flash TP on Party List when above 100% (1000 TP).

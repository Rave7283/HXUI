# Rag's HXUI

This is a fork of the original HXUI (https://github.com/tirem/HXUI/) and some of ConteAlmaviva's work.

This fork:

- Adds the ability to hide distance display from the Target Bar.
- Adds the ability to display distance on Party List and Enemy List.
- Adds the ability to highlight party member names on Party List when within a set distance.
- Adds debuff timers underneath the Target Bar similar to ConteAlmaviva's fork.
- Fixes the timers for multiple debuffs as these were all wrong.
- Cleans up the display of the debuff timers from ConteAlmaviva's fork so it actually looks nice.
